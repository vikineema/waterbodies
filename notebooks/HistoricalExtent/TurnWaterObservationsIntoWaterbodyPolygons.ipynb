    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Water is among one the most precious natural resources and is essential for the survival of life on Earth. For many countries in Africa, the scarcity of water is both an economic and social issue. Water is required not only for consumption but for industries and environmental ecosystems to function and flourish. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the demand for water increasing, there is a need to better understand our water availability to ensure we are managing our water resources effectively and efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Earth Africa (DE Africa)'s [Water Observations from Space (WOfS) dataset](https://docs.digitalearthafrica.org/en/latest/data_specs/Landsat_WOfS_specs.html), provides a water classified image of Africa approximately every 16 days. These individual water observations have been combined into a [WOfS All-Time Summary](https://explorer.digitalearth.africa/products/wofs_ls_summary_alltime) product, which calculates the frequency of wet observations (compared against all clear observations of that pixel), over the full 30-plus years satellite archive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The WOfS All-Time Summary product provides valuable insights into the persistence of water across the African landscape on a pixel by pixel basis. While knowing the wet history of a single pixel within a waterbody is useful, it is more useful to be able to map the whole waterbody as a single object. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a workflow for mapping waterbodies across Africa as polygon objects. This workflow has been used to produce **DE Africa Waterbodies**. "
